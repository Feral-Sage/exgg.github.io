			<b>Solo/Duo PVP 2X E.G.G</b>
			<br/>
			Be aware Mods will be very active on this server! Follow our rules.
			<br/>			
			Please open a ticket to report issues. Do not disclose the
			identities of individuals who are not following the rules in 
			the chat as that might make the individual stop what they are
			doing, making it difficult to catch rule breakers in the act.
			<br/>
			Thank you.

			<h1 align="right">FAQ</h1>
			<b>– VIP (queue skip)</b>
			<br/>
			Thank you for considering to fund our server, 
			covering costs would be nice. The purpose is 
			that funds will solely be used to cover expenses
			or reinvest in the community. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<hr/>
			<br/>
			<b>– Pee Pee 9000</b>
			<br/>
			Pee Pee 9000 is an in-game mechanism that
			will kill you while sleeping once we have
			over 100 sleepers. Since we are a high-population
			server with a queue, please remember to remove
			your kits before logging off.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<hr/>
			<br/>
			<b>- Bi-weekly and Monthly requests</b>
			<br/>
			Since the launch of community servers, 
			we have had a weekly wipe due to some lag 
			issues within the tail end of the weekly wipe 
			cycle. During beta stages on the Public Testing 
			Branch we held the record of holding an 8 day
			streak without being forced to wipe. 
			To claim that we will conduct a wipe every two
			weeks would be untrue due to previous testing.
			Servers (not 100% vanilla) with a 14-day or monthly wipe
			schedule, especially those with a high population
			have a very high possibility of lag or possibly further issues.
			Perhaps we'll attempt it again in the very near future.
			However, at the moment, we do not have a plan for bi-weekly or monthly. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<hr/>
			<br/>
			<b>– Sulfur/Boom</b>
			<br/>
			Being a 2X server with doubled item rates, 
			it often led to crates containing twice the usual boom.
			Excessive boom and faster gathering rates of sulfur had
			created a problem.  While this might sound appealing,
			it made raiding far too easy within a few hours after wipe.
			To address this, we have slowed down the raiding process
			for a more manageable and enjoyable experience for all players.
			Timed charges, satchels, and other explosives have been
			set back to normal levels. Similarly for sulfur ore,
			which is now collected at a vanilla rate.
			This was voted on by our community. The Discord was full
			of people complaining about being raided too quickly and
			excessively before the change. We have seen success with
			this experience.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<hr/>
			<br/>
			<b>– Starts</b>
			<br/>
			We do not provide starts to players. We do not spawn in
			any items for players and try to not affect gameplay for players.
			Please do not message staff for starts. Players within the
			discord can provide starts at their own will. Do not harass
			anyone because you do not want to work for items in the game. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<hr/>
			<br/>
			<b>– Offlining</b>
			<br/>
			Offling is allowed on this server. Base griefing or TC
			griefing is NOT allowed. If you raid a base, congratulations,
			you won. Allow base owners to restart. Release the base
			unless it's affecting your own build. You can place TC
			temporarily to move loot but when you are done please
			release it back to the owner.
