         Please open a ticket to report issues. Do not disclose the identities of individuals who are not following the rules in the chat as that might make the individual stop what they are doing, making it difficult to catch rule breakers in the act.

         Thank you.

		 <b>– VIP (queue skip)</b>
         <br/>
         Thank you for considering to fund our server, covering costs would be nice. The purpose is that funds will solely be used to cover expenses or reinvest in the community. 
         <br/>

		 <b>– Pee Pee 9000</b>
         <br/>
         Pee Pee 9000 is an in-game mechanism that will kill you while sleeping once we have over 100 sleepers. Since we are a high-population server with a queue, please remember to remove your kits before logging off.
         <br/>

		 <hr/>
         <br/>
		 <b>- Bi-weekly and Monthly requests</b>
		 <br/>
         Since the launch of community servers, we have had a weekly wipe due to some lag issues within the tail end of the weekly wipe cycle. During beta stages on the Public Testing Branch we held the record of holding an 8 day streak without being forced to wipe. 
         To claim that we will conduct a wipe every two weeks would be untrue due to previous testing. Servers (not 100% vanilla) with a 14-day or monthly wipe schedule, especially those with a high population have a very high possibility of lag or possibly further issues.
         Perhaps we'll attempt it again in the very near future. However, at the moment, we do not have a plan for bi-weekly or monthly.

		 <b>– Sulfur/Boom</b>
         <br/>
		 Being a 2X server with doubled item rates, it often led to crates containing twice the usual boom. Excessive boom and faster gathering rates of sulfur had created a problem.  While this might sound appealing, it made raiding far too easy within a few hours after wipe. To address this, we have slowed down the raiding process for a more manageable and enjoyable experience for all players. Timed charges, satchels, and other explosives have been set back to normal levels. Similarly for sulfur ore, which is now collected at a vanilla rate. This was voted on by our community. The Discord was full of people complaining about being raided too quickly and excessively before the change. We have seen success with this experience.
         <br/>

         <br/>
		 <b>– Starts</b>
         <br/>
		 We do not provide starts to players. We do not spawn in any items for players and try to not affect gameplay for players. Please do not message staff for starts. Players within the discord can provide starts at their own will. Do not harass anyone because you do not want to work for items in the game. 
         <br/>

         <br/>
		 <b>– Offlining</b>
         <br/>
		 Offling is allowed on this server. Base griefing or TC griefing is NOT allowed. If you raid a base, congratulations, you won. Allow base owners to restart. Release the base unless it's affecting your own build. You can place TC temporarily to move loot but when you are done please release it back to the owner.
